## Things I want to know more about


## Introduction to SQL
  > I learned a lot about SQL especially about Logical Operators and Database Management </br> I made a summary for the Logical Operators and the 4 types of JOIN </br> [My Note](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOyFe-Wg=/?share_link_id=284024926672) I will add what I learned about Database Management ASAP INSHAALLAH

  ## The Command Line
  > I did not expect to learn much from it </br> But this task surprised me about how much information I didn't know about, espically the "man (any command you want)" this shows what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. **So for me this experiance was great.**
