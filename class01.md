## my summary:

> Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann,Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation. The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation.

### Can be used in two main areas:

> In mathematics, it is commonly used to describe how closely a finite series approximates a given function, especially in the case of a truncated Taylor series or asymptotic expansion </br>
> In computer science, it is useful in the analysis of algorithms. </br>
> In both applications, the function g(x) appearing within the O(·) is typically chosen to be as simple as possible, omitting constant factors and lower order terms.</br>
>There are two formally close, but noticeably different, usages of this notation:</br>
> 1 - infinite asymptotics </br>
> 2 - infinitesimal asymptotics.</br>
> This distinction is only in application and not in principle, however—the formal definition for the "big O" is the same for both cases, only with different limits for the function argument.


In fact I find it hard to understand from the first time so I took the information above from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) and for me I will edit this content when I understand the concept of it.
