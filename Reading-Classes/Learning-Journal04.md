## What did I learn today?
I learned about linked lists and how to make a linked list. 


## What should I do differently next time?
I should read more before the lecture. and I need to learn more about time management to make my life easier with this courseÂ 
## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
I need to know more about magic methods and practice what I learned by doing the tasks and trying to solve them by myself and work even harder because I want to be a full stack developer and I want to get a better job.

Todays lecture was better than before so I hope next lecture will be even better inshaalah
