>“Adult learners] are deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire.”

In other words, you should continuously evaluate your learning, and your learning journal is an excellent way to keep track of that. How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning? What details will you record and/or measure? How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?

I evaluate my learning by doing the tasks and see what I learned and what I struggle with I just recap it, if I am still struggling I will google it for sure even I would search for videos on YouTube channels and ask the TAs about it because it is my job to find the answers for my questions, it is my responsibility. 
In today's lecture, I didn't get everything like a 100% so, of course, I need to review the information and see the demo so I can find the parts that I am having a problem with.
 
How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?
 the desire for a better quality of life including having a better job and outcome, and self-development, all of these factors help me to make a decision about my priorities in learning about managing what I should learn first and be specified for the next step.
