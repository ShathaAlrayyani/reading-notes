## Making Database Changes Without SQL

Without migrations, you would have to connect to your database and type in a bunch of SQL commands or use a graphical
tool like PHPMyAdmin to modify the database schema every time you wanted to change your model definition.

In Django, migrations are primarily written in Python, so you donâ€™t have to know any SQL unless you have really advanced
use cases.

## Setting Up a Django Project

Throughout this tutorial, you are going to work on a simple Bitcoin tracker app as an example project.

The first step is to install Django. Here is how you do that on Linux or mac OS X using a virtual environment:

    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    (env) $ pip install "Django==2.1.*"
    ...
    Successfully installed Django-2.1.3

With Django installed, you can create the project using the following commands:

    $ django-admin.py startproject bitcoin_tracker
    $ cd bitcoin_tracker
    $ python manage.py startapp historical_data

to create a model, add this class in historical_data/models.py:

    class PriceHistory(models.Model):
        date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=7, decimal_places=2)
        volume = models.PositiveIntegerField()

add the newly created app to settings.INSTALLED_APPS. Open bitcoin_tracker/settings.py and append historical_data to the
list INSTALLED_APPS, like this:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'historical_data',
    ]
