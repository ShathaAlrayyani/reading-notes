## **Recursion :**
recursion is when the function calls itself directly or indirectly. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.</br>
It is a great technique to reduce you code length and make it readable and easier to write, for example if you want to calculate the factorial of any number instead of repeating the function over and over again you can just use recursion to do it for you in more efficient way.</br>
In order to use recursion correctly, first you need to tell the function where to stop.then you can write the code you want.

## What does the if _ _ name _ _ == “_ _ main _ _”: do?
if _ _ name _ _ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

## What is PyTest?
PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python programming language.</br>
There is some advanteges for using PyTest like : </br>
<ul>
  <li>Very easy to start with because of its simple and easy syntax.
</li>
  <li>Can run tests in parallel.</li>
  <li>Can run a specific test or a subset of tests</li>
  <li>Automatically detect tests</li>
  <li>Skip tests</li>
  <li>Open source</li>
</ul>
