I learned about testing my codes and functions by using pytest in python and how to make modules.


Also how we need to test our code using TDD and it is like baby steps first you need to write the test and get the red color, which means didn't pass the test, then you fix your function and let it pass that test ,gitting the green color, 
then you keep repeating this procedure tell you get the result you want.


I stuggled a bit at first when I was doing the task but after reviewing some youtube videos and the demo.

but I beleive that I miss understood if we can use some of the build in functions like pop() and insert() I used them in code challenge 02.
