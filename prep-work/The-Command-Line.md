## The Command Line
  > I did not expect to learn much from it </br> But this task surprised me about how much information I didn't know about, espically the "man (any command you want)" this shows what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. **So for me this experiance was great.**


 **pwd** which stands for Print Working Directory.
 
 It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.
 
 **ls** It's short for list.
  
 It listed the contents of our current directory.
   
 **ls -a**
 
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
   
   
## Absolute and Relative Paths:
There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative.
Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths.
Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can, in fact,
use either type of path (either way, the system will still be directed to the same location).


 **cd** which stands for change directory.
 
    cd [location]
    
 Move to another directory and if you run the command **cd** without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.
 
**file**

obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

**Everything is a file under Linux**
Even directories.

**Linux is an extensionless system**
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.

**Linux is case sensitive**
Beware of silly typos.

***The man pages are my friend.***
Instead of trying to remember everything, instead remember I can easily look stuff up in the man pages.
